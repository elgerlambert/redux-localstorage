redux-localstorage
==================

Unopinionated store enhancer that persists state changes (locally).

Similarly to redux, redux-localstorage has a small API footprint yet provides great flexibility by embracing functional composition. Through functional composition you can [enhance](#enhancers) your [persistence layer of choice](#storage-1) to meet your specific needs!

## Installation
```js
npm install --save redux-localstorage
```

## The Gist
```js
import {compose, createStore} from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

import persistState, {mergePersistedState} from 'redux-localstorage';
import adapter from 'redux-localstorage/lib/adapters/localStorage';
import filter from 'redux-localstorage-filter';

const reducer = compose(
  mergePersistedState()
)(rootReducer);

const storage = compose(
  filter('nested.key')
)(adapter(window.localStorage));

const enhancer = compose(
  /* applyMiddleware(...middlewares) */
  persistState(storage, 'my-storage-key')
);

const store = createStore(reducer /*, [initialState]*/, enhancer);
```
## API
### persistState([storage][, key][, callback])
#### storage
```js
type storage = Storage (Object)
```
An object that provides ([enhanced](#enhancers)) methods for data persistence, retrieval and removal as put, get & del. Defaults to adapter(window.localStorage).

#### key
```js
type key = String
```
The key used to store (and retrieve) persisted state. Defaults to 'redux-localstorage'.

#### callback
```js
type callback = Function
```
Called when persistState has finished initializing (after rehydration).

### mergePersistedState([merge])
mergePersistedState is a higher order reducer that can be used to rehydrate the store. It takes a function (optional) that defines how the application's initial state should be merged with any persisted state.

#### merge
```js
type merge = (initialState, persistedState) => mergedState
```
Function that defines how the persisted state should be merged with the initial state. By default `mergePersistedState` performs a shallow merge. The following shows how you can easily define a deep merge using e.g. `lodash.merge`:  

```js
const reducer = compose(
  mergePersistedState((initialState, persistedState) => {
    return _.merge({}, initialState, persistedState)
  }),
)(rootReducer);
``` 

**Note:** The `initialState` includes the default values specified by your reducers.

### transformState([down], [up])
A typical use-case for storage enhancers is to modify the state before it's persisted or retrieved, e.g. serialization, encryption or to filter out a subset. transformState is a storage enhancer that makes it easier to do so. 

#### down
```js
type down = Function | Array<Function>
```
A function or an Array of functions that transform the state before it's persisted.
 
#### up
```js
type up = Function | Array<Function>
```
A function or an Array of functions that transform the state directly after it's been retrieved.

```js
import adapter from 'redux-localstorage/lib/adapters/localStorage/adapter.js';

const storage = compose(
  transformState([
    JSON.stringify,
    btoa
  ], [
    atob,
    JSON.parse
  ])
)(adapter(window.localStorage))
``` 

**Note:** transformState is applied internally to enhance storage adapters that require JSON serialization. If serialization is not the last step before persisting, as is the case in this encryption example, make sure you import the actual adapter.js (as opposed to index.js).

## Rehydration
The use of `mergePersistedState` is optional. If you prefer to handle rehydration in your own reducer(s), you can. Listen for redux-localstorage's `INIT` action; it includes the persisted state as it's `payload`. For example:

```js
import {actionTypes} from 'redux-localstorage'

export default function reducer(state = {}, action) {
  if (action.type === actionTypes.INIT) {
    const persistedState = action.payload['reducer']
    return {...state, ...persistedState}
  }
//...
```
**Note:** The `INIT` action is passed on to your reducers by `mergePersistedState` in case you would like to set an `initialised` flag for example.

## Storage
Redux-localstorage can be made to work with any storage implementation - *it doesn't even have to be local!* All that is required is that the storage that is passed in exposes the following methods. 
```js
storage = {
  put(key, value, callback) {},
  get(key, callback) {},
  del(key, callback) {}
};
```
A number of [adapters](#adapters) are provided to wrap existing storage API's so that they conform to these requirements. But you could create your own storage object and point these methods to any endpoint you like!

### adapters
Redux-localstorage currently provides adapters for `localStorage`, `localForage`, `sessionStorage`, `AsyncStorage` and `levelDB`. An adapter creates a thin wrapper that transforms a storage API so that it conforms to the stated requirements. The original storage object passed to an adapter can be accessed through `adapted[0]`; this provides you access to all the original storage methods when creating a storage enhancer.

```js
import {AsyncStorage} from 'react-native';
import adapter from 'redux-localstorage/lib/adapters/AsyncStorage';

const storage = adapter(AsyncStorage);
// storage[0] === AsyncStorage
```
**Note:** the adapters for localStorage, sessionStorage, AsyncStorage & levelDB take care of JSON (de)serialization for you. If you just want the adapter without serialization you can access the `adapter.js` within the corresponding storage folder. See [transformState](#transformstatedown-up) for an example.

### enhancers
```js
type enhancer = (Storage) => Storage
```
Through functional composition it's really easy to enhance a storage object. This provides a lot of flexibility, allowing for fun stuff like:
```js
const storage = compose(
  debounce(100),
  filter(['key', 'another.key']),
  errorHandling,
  yourOwnCustom(enhancer)
)(adapter(window.localStorage));

const enhancer = compose(
  /* applyMiddleware(...middlewares) */
  persistState(storage, 'my-storage-key')
);
```
Check out the wiki for a [list of available storage enhancers](https://github.com/elgerlambert/redux-localstorage/wiki) and don't forget to add your own if you publish any!

## Immutable

By default redux-localstorage assumes your state is a plain JS object. If you are using [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to manage your state you can apply the merge and store enhancer functions provided by [redux-localstorage-immutable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-localstorage-immutable) to enable `redux-localstorage` to understand your values.

To use `redux-localstorage-immutable` with `redux-localstorage` pass the `deserialize` merge function to `mergePersistedState` and apply the `serialize` store enhancer to `compose` before any other store enhancers such as `filter`. 

```
import {compose, createStore} from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

import persistState, {mergePersistedState} from 'redux-localstorage';
import adapter from 'redux-localstorage/lib/adapters/localStorage';
import filter from 'redux-localstorage-filter';

import { serialize, deserialize } from 'redux-localstorage-immutable';

const reducer = compose(
  // apply deserialize from redux-localstorage-immutable
  mergePersistedState(deserialize)
)(rootReducer);

const storage = compose(
  // apply serialize from redux-localstorage-immutable
  serialize,
  filter('nested.key')
)(adapter(window.localStorage));

const enhancer = compose(
  /* applyMiddleware(...middlewares) */
  persistState(storage, 'my-storage-key')
);

const store = createStore(reducer /*, [initialState]*/, enhancer);
```
